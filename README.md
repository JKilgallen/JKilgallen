Hi, I’m Jack Kilgallen.

- When it comes to coding I have a wide range of interests, but I specialize in data science, deep learning, and computational neuroscience.  
- I recently submitted my thesis for a PhD in data science, and now I'm looking to apply my skills and expertise in industry.
- In my spare time, I volunteer with the Irish Coast Guard, both as a first responder, and as a data scientist. Currently, I'm exploring historical incident data to identify seasonal and geographic trends which can be used to improve our operational preparidness.  
- Feel free to contact me at jkilgallen@proton.mail, unless you're working in penetration testing, in which case leaving a text file on my desktop is fine.

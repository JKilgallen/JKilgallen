Hi, I’m Jack Kilgallen.

- When it comes to coding I have a wide range of interests, but I specialize in data science, deep learning, and computational neuroscience.  
- I recently submitted my thesis for a PhD in data science, and now I'm looking to apply my skills and expertise in industry.
- In my spare time, I volunteer with the Irish Coast Guard, both as a first responder, and as a data scientist.
- Feel free to contact me at jkilgallen@protonmail.com, unless you're working in penetration testing, in which case leaving a text file on my desktop is fine.

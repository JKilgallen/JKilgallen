- Hi, I’m Jack Kilgallen.
- I’m interested in all sorts of things, from the more abstract end of things like statistical machine learning and the esoteric world of pure mathematics, 
  to the more applied kinds of research like computational neuroscience. 
- I'm currently working towards a PhD in Data Science which is fully funded by Science Foundation Ireland's Centre for Research Training program.
- I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that will let me apply, and hone, some of the data science skills I've gotten out of my undergraduate degree in computational thinking.
- Feel free to contact me at jkilgallen@pm.me, unless you're working in penetration testing, in which case leaving a text file on my desktop is fine.
